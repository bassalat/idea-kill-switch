# THE AI-POWERED KILL SWITCH

## First Task: AI Pain Research

Feed ChatGPT this exact prompt:

> "Search Reddit, forums, and review sites for people complaining about [your problem]. Find 50+ complaint threads from the last 6 months. Look for phrases like 'there has to be a better way' or 'I hate how [current solution] works.' Give me direct quotes and links."

Then ask: 

> "Analyze these complaints. What specific words do people use? How urgent does their frustration sound? Rate the pain level 1-10."

**If AI can't find real complaints with high urgency, you don't have a real problem.**

❌ No complaints = dead idea.

## Second Task: AI Market Analysis

Use this prompt sequence:

> "Research companies solving [your problem]. Find their pricing, customer reviews, and revenue estimates. I need:
> - 3+ companies charging $50+ monthly
> - Customer testimonials mentioning ROI
> - Evidence people are actually paying these prices
> - Market size estimates"

Follow up with: 

> "Analyze their customer reviews. What do people love? What do they hate? Where are the gaps I could fill?"

AI will map the entire competitive space in minutes.

❌ No money flow = dead idea.

## Third Task: AI Content Creation & Testing

Generate your landing page with AI:

> "Create a landing page for [your solution]. Include:
> - Headline that speaks to the specific pain points you found
> - 3 bullet points of benefits
> - Email signup form copy
> - Social proof placeholder text
> 
> Write it for someone who just complained about this problem on Reddit."

Then create social posts:

> "Write 5 different social media posts announcing my 'coming soon' product. Make each one sound like a real person sharing their frustration, not a sales pitch. Include the signup link naturally."

Post these across LinkedIn, relevant Facebook groups, and Reddit threads where people complained.

**Track signups per post.**

❌ Under 2% signup rate = dead idea.

## BONUS: AI Survey Analysis

Email everyone who signed up using AI-generated copy:

> "Draft a survey email asking my signups what they'd pay monthly to solve [problem]. Make it conversational, not corporate. Include 3 follow-up questions about their current workarounds."

Feed responses back to AI to find the average.

❌ If average willingness to pay is under $50, you have a hobby, not a business.
